A patch for the famos Levels module by theripper93
Levels module here: https://github.com/theripper93/Levels

This module llows for an alternative token-vison, that is more readbly from the top-down perspective. As described here in the bottom picture.

Oiginal Vision:

This aims to combat the confusing vison where you can't see tokens at many vertical angles, but the background from all vertical angels, which many of my players find very confusing.
